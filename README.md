# Provide Insights to Management in Consumer Goods Domain

## About

Atliq Hardwares, a hypothetical leading computer hardware producer in India, seeks to enhance its data analytics capabilities for smarter decision-making. This project involves executing SQL queries to address key business inquiries and presenting insights to executive management, showcasing a blend of technical and soft skills crucial for data-driven strategies.


## Problem Statement

**Domain**:  Consumer Goods | **Function**: Executive Management

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

Task:  

Imagine yourself as the applicant for this role and perform the following tasks

1.    There are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights. Check them.
2.    Run a SQL query to answer these requests. 
3.    The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence create a presentation to show the insights.


## Features

- SQL queries and data analysis to address specific business questions.
- Creation of visualizations to present data insights effectively.


## Project Structure

  - `Metadata.txt`: This text file provides a comprehensive overview of the tables found in the 'gdb023' (atliq_hardware_db) database.
  - `sample_challenge_presentation.pdf`: A sample presentation in PDF format showcasing slide deck similar to what is required to present analysis to top-level management
- `requests_resultset` :
  - `request_code_resultset_images`: PNG images containing SQL queries and resultset from MySQL workbench for each request
  - `resultsets` : CSV files of resultset for each request
- `queries_ad_hoc.sql`: A SQL file containing the Solution I have created to the Ad-Hoc Requests
- `README.md`: The project's documentation.
